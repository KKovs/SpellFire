*Bringing back the magic!*

## **What is it exactly?**
System that lets you chime into World of Warcraft inner mechanisms
and command game using programming language.

Right now only supported WoW verison is **3.3.5a (build 12340)**, however structure of the project should easily let you adapt to other version.

Project goal is to provide clean and maintainable API of a game instrumentation.

## **How does it work?**
The system entails **two** components working together, their general description:

- **Primer**, an application that contains business logic(i.e. routines that specify what game should do and when).
- **Well**, a library that is injected into orchestrated process and exposes API that **Primer** consumes as well as contains business model.

Following technologies were used for implementation:
- **.NET Framework**
- **EasyHook** process hooking library

## **How can I use it?**
- Configure to your needs or use already shipped logic
- Build using modern .NET toolchain
- Start World of Warcraft
- Run **Primer.exe** (ensure **Well.dll** and **EasyHook binaries** are in the same directory as **Primer.exe**)
- ???

*Enjoy **enhanced** game!*

*PS. Please, use this software in a good will* ðŸ˜‰
